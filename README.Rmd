# Tidytuesday `r emo::ji("smile")`
## My weekly commits for the tidytuesday project (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/)  

I've discovered this challenge during another challenge :) the #100DaysOfCode challenge. i've started during March 2020 quarantine for covid19. Hope one day will look back at these days and find a reason to smile and be happy about what i've accomplished. The list starts from the last one in time.

### Year 2020 Episode 27: Uncanny X-men
Here's too hot. Minds are melting. Ideas lacking. Hugs and kisses in X-men  
* learned using fuzzy join  
* learned using geom_edge_fan (pretty useful for the future)  
* learned using magick to set an image as plot background, fun no?

### Year 2020 Episode 26: Caribou tracking  
i found myself unable to face this 

### Year 2020 Episode 25: African American History
This week was so frustrating. I had only complex ideas crazy to realize. This is one example of one idea not working out as expected.

### Year 2020 Episode 24: African American Achievements
Not much datascience this time. I learned using wordcloud2 and other functions of cowplot.

### Year 2020 Episode 23: Marble Races
Thi is absolutely crazy kind of competition. There was not much information in the dataset but i've enjoyed.  
* learned how to add a rastergrob to my plot in ggplot. WOW!

### Year 2020 Episode 22: Cocktails
For this episode i've been happy to check the chapter for of textmining book from D. Robinson and J. Silge. I've used pairwise correlation to analyze correlation among drinks sharing my favourite ingredient: orange. Citing from the book "We may instead want to examine correlation among words, which indicates how often they appear together relative to how often they appear separately. In particular, here we’ll focus on the phi coefficient, a common measure for binary correlation. The focus of the phi coefficient is how much more likely it is that either both word X and Y appear, or neither do, than that one appears without the other." In my plot, words are drinks and the section in the text he's referring to is the ingredient.  
What i've learned:  
* tidying with str_detect() and str_replace()  
* pairwise correlation with the widyr package
* discovered ggpomological which i've used for the color scale of the points/nodes in the network  
* struggled to set a nice font. Will check it in the next episode

### Year 2020 Episode 21: Beach volleyball
For this tidytuesday i really enjoyed learning the basics of ggraph. I was curious of how many players changed their partners during their career and their winning rate. 
What i've learned in this episode:  
* how to tidy a wide format table with pivot_longer(), separate(), and spread().  
* how to prepare data and plot a network with ggraph()

### Year 2020 Episode 20: Volcano Eruptions
For this episode i really wanted to learn a new thing. Of course I ended up with a *magma* option from the viridis package in a density plot type raster. Looks nice and not so many efforts. Etna is the most active volcano in the world and i've been there.. It looks like a parallel universe.
What i've learned:
* how to prepare a raster density plot

### Year 2020 Episode 19: Animal Crossing - New Horizons
For this episode i've explored quite a lot trying to find something interesting until i came up with this plot... Still have to figure out why the months are in italian.. and why i couldnt' set the x_limits properly....

### Year 2020 Episode 18: Broadway
For this episode i was quite thrilled to explore the dataset and learn new things about Broadway. Havent been so far in NY but its on the todolist. 
*plot1*: I was curious to investigate instead the trend in the number of seats sold. Boringly, i've seen is quite stable for the shows that had the most number of seats sold. The average price is not corrected for inflation, will learn it in the next episode.
*plot2*: Here I plotted some the top 10 long-lived shows in Broadway and their contribution to the main Broadway theatre income. I have to admit that the output is a bit boring as, apart from the legendary "The phanthom of the opera" and "The Lion King" , i didn't learn much of new data. I was interested in exploring the revenue trend of each show. Ill not repeat it.

### Year 2020 Episode 17: GDPR Fines
It was not easy this one. I asked several questions. What was the distribution of the fine amounts. I had to use a logscale for this. After this, i was curious about what type of violations people/companies have been doing and i dig a bit into the type of violations and the related articles. I wish i could be a bit better with text manipulation but frankly speaking it's only my 30th day of coding, i can't pretend that much from myself. So i've used a cool function "cut" to divide the fine distribution into segment to see if any specific range was related to a specific type of violation or article violated. It was not, apparently. So i kind of give up and i came back on the most obvious plot: showing the violations by country (total amount of fines received and number of violations)

### Year 2020 Episode 16: BBC - Survey - HipHop - followup
I was not satisfied with my plots. For several reasons:  
- There are two plots and not one  
- I'm kind of tired to show in the same plot a lot of information. What do you want to accomplish? This is not a scientific paper. That's direct communication  
- I didn't like the time on the y-axis, it makes it kind of weird  
So im showing here the main (obvious?) message extracted from the data.  
__important__: I've read the code of i think about the ~80% of the #tidytuesday plots i've seen. That was so instructive.

### Year 2020 Episode 16: BBC - Survey - HipHop
This was a cool one. All of us love music right? I enjoyed digging into this dataset from BBC where a bunch of critics were asked what was their HipHop top 5 personal rank of all time. After a week of r4ds studying, youtube screencasts, i've actually learned what are the basic steps to *easily* handle and explore a dataset. As DR says: "Always start exploring the categorical variables with some counting". After that it comes naturally to focus on some of them, summarize, and search for relationships between each other. Here, it was clear that the most voted songs belong to the 90s and the level has been decreasing since then. That's embarassing but i've no idea about who Public Enemy is!!

### Year 2020 Episode 15: Tour de France
I don't know shit about Tour De France. Very very bad, i agree. In fact, one of my first questions to address was actually discover why i'm so uninterested in this sport. Too boring? too low profile? Does it depend on the geographical area where i was born? In the end i've just (badly) plotted the age of the most winning teams.. Interesting? Well, it still demonstrates that 30+ doesnt mean you're done.
